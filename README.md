Custom gymnasium environment for reinforcement learning to solve a 2D maze with continuous action space. End goal of applying learned model on physical robodog to achieve autonomous navigation.

## Installation
### Create a new conda environment with all dependencies from 2D_maze.yml 
    conda env create -f 2D_maze.yml
    conda activate 2D_maze.yml
Make sure to change the interpreter path to ~/anaconda3/envs/2D_maze/bin/python.
