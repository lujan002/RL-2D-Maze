            It depends on Pillow, a PIL fork (https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/4.2.x/index.html).
            
            The finale internal representation of the maze is a nested list of touched floor tiles that are connected to at

            The maze can be formed by two different algorithms, modified Prim's and Growing Tree. A short 
            explanation of the used algorithms (and many more) can be found at http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm

            http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/27/maze-generation-growing-tree-algorithm
            
            It works on the initial mazeList. The finale mazeList consist of touched floor tiles that are connect
            with each other.
            The end result is a perfect 2D maze that has a variable hardness in solution
            
            This runs much faster than makeMazeSimple and should be used as default.
            
            This algorithm can be modified with two weights between 0 and 100. 
            weightHigh should always be higher or equal to weightLow.
            
            Three extrems:      
                      
            weightHigh == 100, weightLow == 100:
                
                The algorithm always takes the the newst tile out of the choice list and behaves
                like a reversed backtrace. Very hard to solve
                http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking
            
            weightHigh == 100, weightLow == 0
                
                The algorithm always chooses the next tile randomly
                and behaves like Prim's algorithm, but runs much faster.
                Solving is less hard than 100/100

                
            weightHigh == weightLow == 0:
                
                The algorithm always chooses the oldest tile in the list
                The resulting maze will have a lot of long passageways (high river factor) and
                will be trivial to solve.
                
                
            I personally like a 99/97 distribution but feel free to experiment yourself.
             
            A short description of what happens:
            At first one untouched tile is randomly chosen, it is transformed to a
            touched tile and it is put into a list of available tiles.
            
            From this list is a tile chosen, how depends on the weights.
            If this tile has no untouched neighbours it is removed from the list of available tiles.
            Else a neighbour is chosen, marked as touched, put into the availabe tile list and
            connected to the current tile.
            This loops until the list of available tiles is empty.

            will be removed from the maze name and the length will be limited two 120 chars. 
            This will not be done on names that are passed as arguments!
